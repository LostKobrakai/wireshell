**ProcessWire command-line companion**

Version 0.5.1

A command-line interface for CMS/CMF [ProcessWire](https://processwire.com) based on the Symfony Console component.
Can be easily extended through ProcessWire's ability of being bootstrapped into other applications, its great [API](https://processwire.com/api/) and
Symfony Console's [modular command approach](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/introduction%20%20%20%20%20%20.html).

## Usage example

Here's a short demonstration of wireshell. Of course it covers only a small portion of it's functionality, so please have a look at the [list of available commands](commands/backup.md) to see what's possible.
