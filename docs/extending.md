## Symfony Console

Symfony Console is part of the Symfony Framework and a great workbench for command line apps.
There are other command line interfaces for CMS/CMF's around, such as [DrupalConsole](https://github.com/hechoendrupal/DrupalConsole), that are also based on Console.
In general, commands are single classes with a transparent set of dependencies (Input, Output), wrapped in a single app.
Find out more in the [official documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/introduction.html), check out sample code
and also have a look at already created [wireshell commands](https://github.com/wireshell/wireshell/tree/master/src/Commands).
